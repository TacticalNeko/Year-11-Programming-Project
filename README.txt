// Read Me //

Here is my programming project I hope you like it.

I had an absolute blast making this and I also learned a lot too!
I had only ran into 2 issues along the way and solved them with simple solutions.
The issues were comparing the player input from the file.
The other being the leaderboard, which I couldn't figure out in the end and decided to not bother wasting any more time on it.

If you have any feedback on what I should improve, please let me know!
I wanted to make my code as neat as I could, tell me if I did that well.

Also upgraded to Visual Studio as my new IDE.
I really wanted to try and make my program as well as I could so that I would be robust and neat.

Thanks,
- Dylan
